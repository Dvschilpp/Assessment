Follow these steps to run the project:

1) Ensure that if you are running this locally, you have PostgrSQL downloaded and installed on your machine.
2) Run 'Autostart.bat,' if for some reason that doesn't work, run 'db_create.sql' with PostgrSQL
3) Enter the details as they pertain to your server, e.g.

	Server: localhost
	Database: postgres
	Username: root
[OK]
	Password: password
[OK]

4) Execute the SQL query that appears in the window (located in 'db_create.sql' if a window does not appear automatically)


-------Batch file should take over from here-------


5) In command prompt, change directory (cd) into the folder containing 'manage.py'
6) Run the following in the CMD:

python manage.py runserver

7) Redo step 5 and run the following in a new CMD:

python manage.py migrate
python manage.py syncdb

8) Navigate to 127.0.0.1:8000 or 127.0.0.1:5432 in your browser to view the website

9) Navigate to 127.0.0.1:8000/admin or 127.0.0.1:5432/admin and log-in using the superuser information you set earlier

10) Navigate to 'Users' in the menu and click on 'Add'

11) Follow the prompt to add users (they will then appear listed on the homescreen)


-------The following applies mostly if you run into any errors-------



12) If you were unsuccessful with running 'Autostart.bat,' then open the command prompt, type "echo %path%" to ensure the PATH variable has the following directories attached:

C:\Python34;C:\Python34\Scripts

13) If it does not, then in command prompt, run the following code:

set PATH=%path%;C:\Python34;C:\Python34\Scripts
14) If those directories don't apply, then modify them as needed to fit your filesystem
